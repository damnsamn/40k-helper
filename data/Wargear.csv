Unlike the plasteel and ceramite of normal power armour, the artefact is made from plates of raw adamantine, making it all but unbreachable by conventional weaponry. When rained upon with heavier fire, the Armour lndomitus manifests a shimmering force field, the secrets of which have long been lost to modern artificers.|
000001629|The Shield Eternal|Chapter Relics|Model with a storm shield, <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Relic-shield">relic shield</a> or combat shield only.

This magnificently worked storm shield is a bulwark against which all the wrath of a hateful galaxy can crash. Its warding powers turn aside the maleficent attentions of the witch and the daemon, safeguarding its wearer from mortal blows and perfidious warpcraft alike.|
000001630|Teeth of Terra|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with an Astartes chainsword only. This Relic replaces an Astartes chainsword and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The origins of the Teeth of Terra lie shrouded in mystery. Mentions of this large, obsidian-toothed chainsword can be found dotted throughout the histories of many Space Marine Chapters, yet the weapon itself can be traced to no artisans hand, nor can it be found in any Chapter’s Armoury save in times of the greatest need. What is certain is that, when wielded in battle by a true hero of the Imperium, the Teeth of Terra strikes with the force of a thunderbolt, leaving a bloody trail of broken bodies in its wake.|

It is said that its constant proximity to the Master of Mankind has imbued within it indelible traces of his psychic signature. Whatever the truth of this, its presence is a constant inspiration to those loyal to the Emperors cause, instilling them with valour and determination even as their foes quail in its presence.|
000001632|Primarch’s Wrath|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with a boltgun, master-crafted boltgun or special issue bolt carbine only. This Relic replaces a boltgun, master-crafted boltgun or special issue bolt carbine and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The ancient boltgun known as the Primarch’s Wrath is believed to have come from the personal weapons collection of Roboute Guilliman himself. Perhaps the finest example of its kind ever crafted, it has dispensed thunderous death to the foes of Mankind for millennia. Chased in Theldrite moonsilver and inscribed in microscopic lettering with every treatise on tactics that Guilliman ever penned, this weapon’s quality is such that it allows its wielder to sweep away great swathes of the enemy with a storm of armour-piercing, fragmenting bolts.|
000001633|The Burning Blade|Chapter Relics|Model equipped with a power sword or master-crafted power sword only. This Relic replaces a power sword or master-crafted power sword, and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This ancient broadsword is so large and dense that no mere Human could lift it, let alone wield it in battle. It was recovered from the wreckage of Horus’ battle barge, the only unblemished artefact in a chamber crawling with the filthy taint of Chaos. Some artificers have posited that it is the Master of Mankind’s greatness that shines out from its sacred steel. In the heat of battle, the sword blazes so brightly that it can melt through even the thickest armour.|

In battle, this cloak can turn blades and bolts aside in a shower of flame, mimicking the durability of the fire-breathing beast it was made from.|
000001636|The Axe of Medusa|Relics of Medusa|Model equipped with a power axe only. This Relic replaces a power axe and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The Axe of Medusa, said to have been forged by Manus’ own hand, is held by the Iron Council and given to the Chapter’s chosen war leader as a badge of office. For over three centuries this weapon has been wielded by Kardan Stronos, but when dispatching another champion of the Iron Hands on a vital mission, Stronos has been known to bestow it as a mark of favour and faith.|

However, closer inspection reveals it to be a technological marvel, now well beyond the skills of the Imperium’s finest artificers. With miniaturised plasma-engines in place of traditional ram jets, the Raven’s Fury provides its wearer with a lightning turn of speed when boosting into battle.|

None know who crafted this relic, but it is gifted to whichever White Scars Librarian demonstrates the greatest skill in the Arts of Heaven. Said to channel spirits of the tempest, the mantle allows the wearer to wield the wrath of the storm itself. At such times, the Stormseer’s eyes glow with a harsh light and his voice is that of a raging hurricane.|
000001639|Fist of Vengeance|Relics of the Fists|<span class="kwb">CRIMSON</span> <span class="kwb">FISTS</span> model with a power fist only. This Relic replaces a power fist and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This master-crafted power fist is blood red, and chipped and marked with hundreds of battle scars. Forged many years before the cataclysm that almost destroyed the Crimson Fists, the Fist of Vengeance was recovered from the ruins of the Chapter’s fortress monastery. In the years since that dark day, this symbol of resilience and defiance has been borne into battle by many heroes of the Chapter.|

Worked into its ancient vox-piece is the jawbone of Saint Sebatus the Ancient, a sanctified relic that emboldens the voice of the wearer so that his oratory soars above the clash of battle. The hearts of nearby battle-brothers are filled with zealous fire, and none can stand before their fury.|
000001642|The Spartean|Relics of the Fists|<span class="kwb">IMPERIAL</span> <span class="kwb">FISTS</span> model with a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol only. This Relic replaces a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This bolt pistol is a true work of the artificer’s art. Since its forging in M35, hundreds of warriors have used the pistol to myriad enemies of Mankind. All of its bearers have remarked upon the weapon’s potent and noble machine spirit, a presence so manifest that it felt as though the weapon was a battle-brother stood always at their side.|

It rages against its eternity of servitude, resulting in grievous violence against the enemy and, sometimes, its owner or his allies.|
000001685|The Black Mace|Artefacts of Chaos|Model with power maul or accursed crozius only. The Black Mace replaces the bearer’s power maul or accursed crozius and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This malefic mace is said to have been cursed by each of the Daemon Primarchs. One who is struck by it instantly collapses into a mouldering pile of bones, while the curse spreads in a deadly shock wave.|
000001686|The Murder Sword|Artefacts of Chaos|Model with power sword only. The Murder Sword replaces the bearer’s power sword and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|So deadly are the wounds from this blade that some believe it is actually the Anathame – the weapon suspected to have laid low Warmaster Horus within the swamps of Davin’s moon. The sword is undoubtedly of eldritch provenance, for with a sacrificial ritual it can become the bane of a certain foe above all others.|

The Cursed Crozius replaces the bearer’s power maul or accursed crozius and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This was once the rod of office for a founding member of Lorgar’s Chaplains, one of the first of his kind to be sent into the Legiones Astartes in order to watch for signs of sedition. In truth, it has always been the weapon of an arch-traitor. First used in anger to bludgeon a Praetor of the White Scars to death, it still bears the indelible stains of that first treacherous kill to this day. The wielder of the Cursed Crozius is instilled with all the knowledge they need to slay the loyalist thralls of the Corpse God.|

The bearer of the Fleshmetal Exoskeleton has a Save characteristic of 2+. In addition, this model heals 1 wound at the start of each of your turns.||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The fleshmetal exoskeleton so prized by the Eye of Terror’s Warpsmiths bonds with the wearer’s wargear and anatomy alike, so that they embody the maxim ‘Iron Within, Iron Without’ in a quite literal sense. A blade that manages to penetrate his armour will blunt itself on the hardened flesh beneath, and those enemies that somehow deal the warrior significant damage will see their adversary’s cabled muscles reknit in a frenzy of silvered fibres until they are rebuilt as strong as ever.|

A psyker with the temerity to unleash eldritch power near this relic finds his mind screaming with pain. Moments later, the empyric energies he has conjured into being are turned back upon him in a raging inferno of white-hot flame. Those who succumb are immediately sucked into Khorne’s realm, there to die a thousand times over.|
000001691|Blade of the Hydra|Artefacts of Chaos|<span class="tooltip00682" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00682" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00682"><span class="kwb">ALPHA</span> <span class="kwb">LEGION</span></span> model with chainsword only. The Blade of the Hydra replaces the bearer’s chainsword and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|Long ago, this oversized chainsword was of purely ceremonial use. Since the Daemon Prince Gharual of the Nine Sundered Souls was bound inside it, however, the blade has been a fiendish tool of destruction. Those with a will strong enough to control its multiple thirsting mindsets can cause the sawtoothed blade to shimmer into not one, but several swords that gnaw and gnash with an immortal hunger. These extra blades are insubstantial when the wielder wills it, and razor-sharp when the flesh of his enemies is near.|
000001692|Claws of the Black Hunt|Artefacts of Chaos|<span class="tooltip00683" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00683" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00683"><span class="kwb">NIGHT</span> <span class="kwb">LORDS</span></span> model with two lightning claws only. The Claws of the Black Hunt replaces both of the bearer’s lightning claws and have the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|These vicious hooked talons have spilt the blood of thousands of victims since their creation in the soul forges. Worn by the master of the Black Hunt, a vicious ritual that precedes the greatest of Night Lords invasions, they are so encrusted with gore they are almost black. This congealed fluid is so thick it cannot even be seared away by the vicious energy field that runs about each claw. This is seen by some as a clear sign of a gory blessing from destructive gods. Even when the wielder swipes the air near a foe, not quite making contact, the victim’s armour and flesh still mysteriously part as if slashed open by a fierce and invisible beast.|
000001693|Blissgiver|Artefacts of Chaos|<span class="tooltip00684" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00684" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00684"><span class="kwb">EMPEROR’S</span> <span class="kwb">CHILDREN</span></span> model with bolt pistol only. Blissgiver replaces the bearer’s bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This long-tongued whip can render those who feel its sting insensible with indescribable pleasure. Even those who put aside gratification for a greater duty find their oaths and promises forgotten, washed away in a tide of sensation that drowns the mind completely. So it is to feel the kiss of Slaanesh. Though their lives are cruelly torn away almost immediately afterwards, for a few short moments, they truly know ecstasy and agony entwined.|
000001694|Fury of Deimos|Relics of Titan|Model equipped with a storm bolter or master-crafted storm bolter only. This Relic replaces a storm bolter or master-crafted storm bolter and has the following profile:||true|GK|Grey Knights|When the moon of Deimos was gifted to Titan by the Adeptus Mechanicus, it carried with it a ship loaded with some of the finest weapons the Imperium has ever created. Among them was the Fury of Deimos, a weapon crafted by the first Fabricator General of Mars in the aftermath of the Horus Heresy.

This Relic replaces a Nemesis daemon hammer and has the following profile:||true|GK|Grey Knights|This is the first Nemesis daemon hammer, upon which all others are based.

This Relic replaces a Nemesis force halberd and has the following profile:||true|GK|Grey Knights|Over centuries of war, a fraction of a Grey Knight’s essence may imprint itself upon his weapon. In rare cases, this imprint is so strong that it persists after death, and another can wield the blade to combine their own psychic might with that of a fallen hero.

Its elementary but bloodthirsty machine spirit has been blamed for a series of unfortunate ‘accidents’ on the field of battle.

Soul Bane replaces the bearer’s ritual dagger and has the following profile:||true|CD|Chaos Daemons|This incorporeal blade inflicts no harm upon its victim’s physical body, instead carving its way through the stuff of his very soul. So ephemeral and unreal is this strange weapon that it is impossible to cross blades with Soul Bane, for its ghostly edge will pass straight through any guard. Those struck by Soul Bane collapse in agony, writhing and screaming as their lacerated souls slowly bleed away into the aether.|

In addition, once per game you can re-roll a single failed <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw">saving throw</a> for the wearer, but if the re-roll results in a 1, the wearer is immediately slain.||true|CD|Chaos Daemons|The wearer of this robe exists between several realities at once. Thus can a daemonic commander potentially control Tzeentch’s interests in multiple times and places at once to further several aspects of the Great Plan. This effect makes it hard for foes to truly harm the wearer, who flickers in and out of reality in an unpredictable fashion. However, the robe is capricious, and has been known to rip its wearer out of reality altogether should he lose control of its powers.|

Corruption replaces the model’s plaguesword, balesword, bileblade or hellforged sword and has the following profile:||true|CD|Chaos Daemons|This fabled weapon is the literal manifestation of corruption. Constantly dripping with foul ooze, the merest scratch from its plague-ridden edge is enough to lay low the hardiest foe, and its toxins can effortlessly overcome even the resilience of a Space Marine.|

Roll 3D6; if the total exceeds that model’s Leadership characteristic, it cannot act until the end of the phase (i.e. it cannot move, manifest psychic powers, shoot, charge or fight) and it cannot use any abilities on its <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Datasheets-1">datasheet</a> that affect another unit (e.g. <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Aura-Abilities">aura abilities</a> and abilities that heal other models).||true|CD|Chaos Daemons|This gem was the purest diamond in the Aeldari empire in the time before the Fall. It was a source of jealous pride to its keeper, a noble by the name of Ydrisyll, who spent ever more time transfixed by its beauty.

Soulstealer replaces the sword and has the following profile:||true|CD|Chaos Daemons|This gluttonous blade gulps down the souls of its victims before invigorating body of its wielder. Its soulgreed stems from the starving Keeper of Secrets bound within – an arrogant entity that sought to devour enough Aeldari souls to challenge Slaanesh himself. As punishment for the Daemon’s monstrous hubris, Slaanesh trapped it within Soulstealer, condemning the Keeper of Secrets for eternity.|

The slothful claws replace the bearer’s ravaging claws and has the following profile:||true|CD|Chaos Daemons|Formed from the essence of a Keeper of Secrets, these claws have taken many guises and been bound to the flesh of countless Heralds over the millennia. When the Slothful Claws strike, the blow appears clumsy and ponderous to its victim. This is but an illusion; in truth, these claws strike like lightning while the foe reels in sluggish confusion.|
000001967|Seer’s Bane|Sorcerous Arcana|Model equipped with a force sword or Prosperine khopesh only. This Relic replaces a force sword or Prosperine khopesh and has the following profile:||true|TS|Thousand Sons|The Seer’s Bane is a daemon weapon, quenched in the blood of a grand vizier and bound tight with a thousand curses. Its magic-infused alloys form the prison for the disgraced Lord of Change Malach'raccatax, who once uttered an unvarnished truth in the presence of Lord Tzeentch. It is said this ensorcelled weapon is the bane of learned foes, and that it can cut through the thoughts of those that earn its master’s ire as easily as it slices apart their flesh.|

When donned, the helm exudes crystalline strands that bore into the wearer’s scalp and conjoin the daemon’s eye with their living mind. So do they perceive the artefact’s unnatural warnings, perceiving the shadows of things yet to come and gleaning how best to react to these events before they even transpire.|
000001970|Coruscator|Sorcerous Arcana|Model equipped with an inferno bolt pistol only. This Relic replaces an inferno bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|TS|Thousand Sons|Of all the warp-forged weapons carried to battle by the Thousand Sons, Coruscator is the most revered. Since the time of the Horus Heresy, it has taken the lives of countless loyalist Space Marines, and its daemonic spirit will take any chance to stoke the fires of hatred that eat away at the Imperium from within.|

The T’au were unwilling to lose his tactical and strategic brilliance, and upon his death, his mind was scanned and his accumulated memories committed to a holostoragepersonality unit on his birth world of Dal’yth. A sliver of that genius has been crafted into a bio-chip. When surgically implanted into the brain of a Fire Caste Commander, the bearer can access much of the wisdom of Puretide himself, drawing upon a great reservoir of tactical acumen.|

This Relic has the following profile:||true|TAU|T’au Empire|Onager gauntlets were developed during the Damocles Crusade to counter the massed heavy armour spearheads of the Imperium. Armed with such a weapon, a warrior could punch straight through the thick armour of a tank, though the technology proved successful, the casualty rate amongst bearers was extremely high, and of the original twelve prototypes, only one remains.|

Many foes have been fatally wrong-footed by this cunning device.|

This advanced prototype is based upon the refraction technology utilised to such tremendous effect by Ghostkeel battlesuits, adapted for alternative armour chassis. Armour nodes project multiple light-distortion fields, creating false images of the bearer to draw enemy fire.|

Each time a Reanimation Protocol roll is made for those reanimation protocols, add 1 to the result.||true|NEC|Necrons|The Orb of Eternity is thought to be the first resurrection orb ever created. For millennia, it rested in a primitive fane on the world of Ormandus, where the indigenous populace marvelled at its ability to effect repairs upon their technologies. Ever since this state of affairs was righted by a host of Triarch Praetorians, the orb has been imparted as a boon to those nobles who are deemed worthy.|
000002001|Voidreaper|Relics of the Aeons|Model with warscythe or voidscythe only. Voidreaper replaces the bearer’s warscythe or voidscythe and has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|Legend has it that on the day the Nightbringer was sundered into shards, this warscythe appeared in the armoury of the Nekthyst Dynasty’s crownworld. Its blade is a sliver of the void, and when swung, it cuts through more than just mere physical forms. Its victims drop to the ground as husks, their souls torn from their bodies before dissipating with final screams of horror.|
000002004|Gauntlet of the Conflagrator|Relics of the Aeons|The Relic has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|Crafted by the Cryptek Harriapt the Conflagrator, this gauntlet uses interdimensional energy-exchangers to open a microscopic conduit to the raging heart of a star. The superheated plasmic flame that erupts through this hole is forced down a cone of hyper-dense gravitons that spew the energy forth in a blazing cloud.|

If two units are set back up on the battlefield using this Relic, both units must be placed wholly within 6" of each other.||true|NEC|Necrons|This device was fashioned from transpositanium, a substance so rare that it can only be found in a handful of places in the galaxy. It is highly sought after by the Necrons, and wars have been waged to secure it. Activated with a thought, the veil causes space and time to warp around its user and those near them, enfolding them in a swirling darkness. As the darkness fades, the user and their comrades appear elsewhere on the battlefield, transported through a miracle of arcane science.|
000002006|Nanoscarab Casket|Relics of the Aeons|Each time the bearer uses its <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/necrons/#Living-Metal">Living Metal</a> ability, it regains 1 additional lost wound.||true|NEC|Necrons|Invented by the Cryptek Onyx Swarm, this vial of black crystal is filled with thousands of tiny Canoptek automatons.

These gossamer-thin plates are formed from phase-hardened amarathine and threads of adamantine.

000002010|Voltaic Staff|Relics of the Aeons|Model with a staff of light only. This Relic replaces a staff of light and has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|The Voltaic Staff is the pinnacle of the art of aethermancy. Blazing arcs of lightning continuously ripple down the shaft of this onyx stave, and the bearer can send these electrostatic beams hurtling towards their enemies with fearsome rapidity. Living targets are enveloped in a searing halo of bone charring voltage, while vehicles find their guidance systems burned out and their hulls peeled open.|
000002011|Blood Scythe|Relics of the Aeons|<span class="kwb">NOVOKH</span> model with a voidscythe or warscythe only. This Relic replaces a voidscythe or warscythe and has the following profile:||true|NEC|Necrons|It is said that Ultep the Divider fought ten thousand duels and was never once defeated. He is amongst the Novokh’s greatest heroes, venerated to this day by the dynasty’s warrior cults. Only the untrammelled power of a rampaging C’tan finally scattered Ultep’s metal body to atoms, though his crimson war scythe survived his destruction. Forged from sanguiphagic star-metal alloys, a single cut from this blade can draw a torrent of blood from an opponent.|

Upon biting into their flesh, the target’s very soul is leeched and transferred back to the gun’s wielder. As the luckless victim withers like rotten fruit, their killer flushes with vigour.|
000002019|The Helm of Spite|Artefacts of Cruelty|In your opponent’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#PSYCHIC-PHASE">Psychic phase</a>, the bearer can attempt to <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Deny-the-Witch">deny</a> one psychic power as if it were a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#PSYCHIC-PHASE"><span class="kwb">PSYKER</span></a>.

Not only do they tempt the gaze of She Who Thirsts, but they also risk the wrath of Asdrubael Vect. Through necessity, the Drukhari’s psychic abilities have atrophied, leaving them vulnerable to the warpcraft of their foes. The Helm of Spite redresses this imbalance, shielding its wearer from harm and setting up a field of violent psionic feedback.|
000002020|The Nightmare Doll|Artefacts of Cruelty|<span class="tooltip00722" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00722" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00722"><span class="kwb">HAEMONCULUS</span></span> model only. Each time the bearer would lose a wound, roll one D6: on a 4+, that wound is not lost.||true|DRU|Drukhari|Should the owner of the Nightmare Doll be harmed in battle, his injuries are absorbed by this creature. If its owner is riddled with bullets, tiny holes appear in the thing’s writhing body whilst its master remains whole. Should the Haemonculus be hit by a decapitating strike, the foe’s blade will pass through his gnarled neck without leaving so much as a scratch.|
000002021|The Animus Vitae|Artefacts of Cruelty|The Animus Vitae has the following profile:||true|DRU|Drukhari|Tire Animus Vitae appears to be a smooth orb, until it is thrown at the feet of a victim and explodes into a lashing tangle of barbed wires that wrap around its prey. Slowly and spitefully, the Animus Vitae begins to constrict, cutting through armour, flesh and bone until its victims agonised cries become desperate screams. All the while the foul weapon radiates this agony, saturating the battlefield with pain so that the bearer and his kin can drink it in like a potent draught.|
000002022|The Triptych Whip|Artefacts of Cruelty|<span class="tooltip00723" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00723" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00723"><span class="kwb">SUCCUBUS</span></span> model equipped with an agoniser only. This Relic replaces an agoniser and has the following profile:||true|DRU|Drukhari|Created in the nascent days of Commorragh’s arenas, the Triptych Whip is a fusion of three masterfully balanced agonisers. Since then it has been borne by only a handful of Succubi, passed down to one skilled enough to slay its bearer in gladiatorial combat.|

Through the projection of rapidly modulating and overlapping energy fields, coupled with a steady emission of warding incense and a cycling barrage of data-hymnals, this device wards away the furious fire of the enemy. It does not even require tilting and angling like a typical ion shield, for its effects wreathe the Knight suit in an all-encompassing field of protective energies and holy wards. The resultant field clings to the Knight like an energised second skin, flexing and shifting with its movement and protecting it from even close-quarters attacks.|
000002061|Ravager|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|Model with a reaper chainsword only. Ravager replaces the bearer’s reaper chainsword and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This storied reaper chainsword has claimed millions of lives during its long service to the knightly houses. The chainsword’s razor-sharp teeth were harvested from the canines of a long-extinct species of bio-horror called a Balethrox. What makes this fact so startling is that dozens of the fell creatures must have been hunted down and slain by brave Knights in order to secure enough fangs to line Ravager’s cutting blade. However, witnessing the murderous wrath of this chainblade’s touch in battle more than justifies the dedication of those long-dead Knights, and its bearer will fight all the harder to honour their sacrifice.|
000002062|The Paragon Gauntlet|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|Model with a thunderstrike gauntlet only. The Paragon Gauntlet replaces the bearer’s thunderstrike gauntlet and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|It is believed that this masterwork weapon was the prototype for the thunderstrike gauntlet – the first, perfect copy fabricated by a longlost STC that was developed on Mars during the Age of Technology. It was that same STC that was integral to the founding of the Knight worlds themselves, by equipping Mankind’s first colonisation fleets with the knowledge to build the mighty armoured suits. If true, it would certainly explain the incredible level of artifice that went into the gauntlet’s creation.|
000002063|Armour of the Sainted Ion|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|The wearer’s Knight has a Save characteristic of 2+.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This exceptionally crafted carapace bodyglove is worn by the Noble pilot. It is studded with secondary couplings and electrosockets that couple with the machineries of the Throne Mechanicum in a similar fashion to the pilot’s neural jacks. Once bonded in this fashion, the micro-generators within the armour thrum to life. They project streams of ionic energy, not only wreathing the pilot and their Throne in a protective shield, but reinforcing and protecting the Knight’s internal systems. Thus, even shots and blows that penetrate the outer shell of the Knight’s armour may fail to cause any harm.|
000002064|Endless Fury|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|Model with an avenger gatling cannon only. Endless Fury replaces the bearer’s avenger gatling cannon and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This remarkable avenger gatling cannon is fitted with ballistic microfabricators that churn out fresh ammunition as fast as it can be fired. Rumours persist of the weapon’s wielders being driven slowly mad with bloodlust, but even if there is truth to these claims, it is seen as a small price to pay for the power unleashed.|
000002065|Judgement|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|Model with a stormspear rocket pod only. Judgement replaces the bearer’s stormspear rocket pod and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This unique rocket pod fires self-propelled adamantine tipped warheads fitted with servitor brains and running venatoris auto-targeting protocols. Once launched, these projectiles mercilessly hunt their prey across the battlefield.|
000002066|Skyshield|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|Model with a twin Icarus autocannon only. Skyshield replaces the bearer’s twin Icarus autocannon and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|These formidable Icarus autocannons boast auto-predictive targeting cogitators and a vengeful machine spirit whose eternal vigilance is well proven.|
000002067|Helm of the Nameless Warrior|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00727" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00727" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00727"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">IMPERIALIS</span></span> model only.

Regardless of its origins, the Helm of the Nameless Warrior has become synonymous with murderous ferocity in battle.|

In addition, if the bearer is within range of an <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Objective-Markers">objective marker</a> (as specified in the mission), it controls that objective marker even if there are more enemy models within range of the same objective marker. If an enemy unit within range of the same objective marker has a similar ability, then the objective marker is controlled by the player who has the most models within range of it as normal – in this case, however, the bearer counts as 10 mod||true|QI|Imperial Knights|A gift from Lord Solar Macharius himself to honour the knightly houses that accompanied his crusade, this banner was borne to battle by a Knight Seneschal in every engagement in which the Knights fought alongside the Warmaster. Legend has it that the Banner of Macharius Triumphant has never seen defeat: every time a Knight has carried it to war, a great victory has been won for the Imperium. To see its majestic form fluttering in the wind instils the Emperor’s warriors with great courage, for to fight in its shadow is to all but assure victory.|
000002069|Traitor’s Pyre|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00727" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00727" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00727"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">IMPERIALIS</span></span> model with a conflagration cannon only. Traitor’s Pyre replaces the bearer’s conflagration cannon and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This ornate conflagration cannon was borne upon a three-hundredand-fifty year pilgrimage to the cardinal world of Basphoria, so that it might be blessed by Saint Gauschwyn the Wrathful. The saint’s spiritual influence fortified the weapon’s machine spirit and greatly enhanced its ferocity, imparting a portion of Gauschwyn’s infamous wrath upon it.|

Roll a D6 at the start of your turn. On a 6 the bearer regains D3 lost wounds; on any other result it regains 1 lost wound.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|A device forged in the shape of the cog of Mars, the Mark of the Omnissiah is an incredibly potent self-repair hub. If the Knight suit upon which it is affixed takes battle damage, reconstruction protocols automatically engage to repair rents and restore lost power.|
000002071|The Helm Dominatus|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00731" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00731" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00731"><span class="kwb">QUESTOR</span> <span class="kwb">MECHANICUS</span> <span class="kwb2">&lt;<span class="kwb3">H</span>OUSEHOLD&gt;</span> <span class="kwb">QUESTORIS</span> <span class="kwb">CLASS</span></span> or <span class="tooltip00732" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00732" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00732"><span class="kwb">DOMINUS</span> <span class="kwb">CLASS</span></span> model only.

Cawl’s Wrath replaces the bearer’s plasma decimator and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|During his centuries-long efforts to reduce the size and increase the portability of advanced plasma weaponry, Archmagos Cawl created this singular plasma decimator. Its enhanced containment fields and machine spirit data-shackles allow it to generate even more lethal volumes of energy than a typical example of such a weapon.|
000002073|The Thunder of Voltoris|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00734" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00734" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00734"><span class="kwb">HOUSE</span> <span class="kwb">TERRYN</span></span> model with rapid-fire battle cannon only. The Thunder of Voltoris replaces the bearer’s rapid-fire battle cannon and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|Originally, Thunder of Voltoris was a defensive cannon mounted upon the battlements of House Terryn’s mountainous stronghold. During the Khybus Schism, the traitors of the Sevenskull Cult attempted to assassinate the house’s ruler as he walked beyond the safety of his fortress walls. Thunder of Voltoris is said to have fired of its own volition, a miraculous discharge that slew the traitors in a ball of flame and saved High King Nathanial. To honour the weapon’s machine spirit, Nathanial had the artillery piece removed and fashioned into a battle cannon that could be borne to glory by his scions until the end of days.|
000002074|Mark of the Lance|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00735" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00735" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00735"><span class="kwb">HOUSE</span> <span class="kwb">GRIFFITH</span></span> model only. Each time the bearer completes a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">charge move</a>, choose an enemy unit within 1" of it and roll a D6. On a 2+ that unit suffers D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a>; on a 6 it suffers 3 mortal wounds instead.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|A Noble who has won victory in the fabled Field of Adamantium tourney earns the right to bear this unique mark of honour into battle. Micro-circuitry woven into the honour pennant sends jolts of electrical force surging through the Knight’s melee weaponry, enhancing the pilot’s already proven skill in one-to-one combat.|
000002075|Angel’s Grace|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00736" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00736" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00736"><span class="kwb">HOUSE</span> <span class="kwb">HAWKSHROUD</span></span> model only.

It was crafted by the artificers of the Blood Angels Chapter to honour a debt to one of House Hawkshroud’s devoted Knights who fought alongside them on Theska II. Unnatural manifestations of empyric power, the malefic conjurations of damned sorcerers, and all other forms of foul witchery are warded away by the Angel’s Grace, lending credence to the claim that whoever sits their Throne beneath the ornate device enjoys the personal protection of the Primarch Sanguinius himself|
000002076|The Hunter’s Eye|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00737" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00737" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00737"><span class="kwb">HOUSE</span> <span class="kwb">CADMUS</span></span> model only. Enemy units do not receive the bonus to their saving throws for <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-and-Cover">cover</a> against the bearer’s ranged attacks.||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This remarkable data-manifold was recovered by the Nobles of House Cadmus almost eight millennia ago, during a crusade amidst the blighted tech-graves of Kossok’s World. It surrounds a Noble’s Throne with a remarkable holo-projected bio-scan and engine-signature readout whose gaze penetrates the densest terrain as though it were not there. Thus, the pilot is able to direct their fury against even those enemies who believe themselves wholly safe and undetected.|
000002077|Honour’s Bite|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00738" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00738" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00738"><span class="kwb">HOUSE</span> <span class="kwb">MORTAN</span></span> model with a reaper chainsword only. Honour’s Bite replaces the bearer’s reaper chainsword and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|Honour’s Bite was fashioned by a conclave of artificer-magi from the forge world of Ionus X. It was created as payment for the heroic sacrifice of High King Garthalomew Mortan, who stood alone in his Knight Paladin Lord of the Hunt against three enraged Squiggoths during the Dastorvol evacuation. Garthalomew successfully held off the trio of greenskin beasts, slaying the third even as it laid him low. In the process, he protected the entire tech-magi conclave of Dastorvol, allowing them to escape their overrun planet without a single casualty. Garthalomew’s descendants have wielded Honour’s Bite in his name ever since.|

Fury of Mars replaces the bearer’s thermal cannon and has the following profile:||true|QI|Imperial Knights|This remarkable weapon channels the fires of the Red Planet’s hottest forges, eradicating its victims even at extreme range. It is said that to face the Fury of Mars is to be subjected to the killing ire of the Omnissiah himself, and to be struck down without mercy.|
000002080|The Headsman’s Mark|Heirlooms of the Noble Houses|<span class="tooltip00741" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00741" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00741"><span class="kwb">HOUSE</span> <span class="kwb">KRAST</span></span> model only.

Those amongst their ranks who have struck the killing blow against such an enemy earn the right to bear the Headsman’s Mark. More than just a badge of respect, this amulet feeds the pilot with targeting data that bolsters their giant-slaying skills still further.|

When its handle is given a sharp twist, the blade splits and splits again until it resembles a sheaf of gleaming tentacles - or a striking hydra - more than it does a conventional blade.

When Vockor Mai’s charismatic allure proved ineffective against the hivelord Thorne due to a protective artefact, Mai crept into the mans bathhouse and slashed his throat with the razored edge of this metallic wyrm-form. In the legends of the Hivecult, the talisman harbours some of that malevolent and murderous intent to this day, and glows hot in the presence of those who have earned the cult’s ire.|

A model with this Relic has a 4+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a> against attacks made with ranged weapons.||true|QT|Chaos Knights|At some point during M33, the Warpsmiths of the Iron Warriors crafted an artefact named for the Traitor Legion’s Daemon world. Known as the Veil of Medrengard, this device appears to be based off an STC that either has not been uncovered in any other part of the galaxy, or has been so twisted by warp corruptions as to become unrecognisable. When installed in a Knight suit, it projects a barrier of energy of far greater power than a standard ion shield. The Veil of Medrengard was originally gifted to the Fallen Nobles of House Garras for their service during the Horus Heresy, but has since been passed to many other Iconoclast houses.|

When a Fallen Noble activates this cursed shield, psychic barriers are silenced and force fields blink out of existence. By removing the esoteric defences of both their enemies and their own Chaos Knight, the pilot opens a window in which unadulterated carnage can occur.|

000002376|The Diamonas|Artefacts of Tyranny|Model equipped with a laser destructor only. This Relic replaces a laser destructor and has the following profile:||true|QT|Chaos Knights|Towards the end of the Moirae Schism in M35, a radical sub-sect of the Moirae creed known as the Xarisians indulged in rampant techno-heresy in the attempt to win the civil war that split the Adeptus Mechanicus. Hunted down as hereteks even by the members of their own creed, the dark adepts of the Xarisians were slaughtered and their malefic technologies destroyed. However, one of their creations – the powerful laser destructor known as the Diamonas – survived the war, and it is said that many bitter battles have been fought amongst the Fallen households for its possession.|

When a Chaos Knight bearing this heraldry arrives within a war zone, planets in nearby sectors that have sworn fealty to the Tyrant’s household will do anything to fulfil the tithes that are demanded. Whole continents are stripped of resources and offered as tribute, while cities are slaughtered in bloody sacrifice. But these runes are not merely symbolic. In battle, the power of the warp pulsates from this banner, enrapturing the servants of darkness, binding them to the pilot’s will.|
000002378|The Teeth That Hunger|Artefacts of Tyranny|Model equipped with a reaper chainsword only. This Relic replaces a reaper chainsword and has the following profile:||true|QT|Chaos Knights|It is said the deadly sharp teeth of this reaper chainsword spin thrice the speed of lesser weapons, resulting in a horrific scream roaring from the weapon as it cuts through its foes. However, to bear such a weapon is to forever fight to keep its insatiable hunger at bay, for if it is not given enough souls to devour, it may instead feed upon the life force of the Knight who carries it.|

Ten thousand years later, his works are still without equal.|
000002440|Vengeance of Ultramar|Relics of Macragge|Model equipped with a storm bolter only. This Relic replaces a storm bolter and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Last used during the Tyrannic Wars, this ancient storm bolter houses a ferocious machine spirit capable of a dramatically increased rate of fire. Furthermore, though the Vengeance of Ultramar fires standardissue bolts, a compact micro-forge within the weapon’s firing chamber anoints each projectile with a bio-reactive coating that burns away flesh and chitin like parchment in a raging fire.|

When the bearer shoots with that weapon, you can choose for it to fire a hellfury bolt. If you do, you can only make one attack with that weapon, but when resolving that attack, if it scores a hit it inflicts 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> on the target and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|It was the Ultramarines who bore the brunt of the First Tyrannic War, and they and their successors have fought against this ghastly xenos threat countless times since.

It is written in the Scrolls of the Plains that the Hunter’s Eye – an ingeniously constructed bionic eye of great age and unrivalled quality – was created in honour of this aspect of the White Scars’ heritage. This device picks out augurassessed weak spots in the quarry’s defences, enabling its wearer to strike with uncanny accuracy or to relay this information via datagheists to any other friendly forces engaging the target.|

The oldest relics of the Chapter date back to that ancient time, and the Banner of the Eagle is one such artefact. It is incredibly rare for this venerable standard to be brought forth into the crucible of war, though any wily commander knows the inspirational effect that such a sacred banner can have on those that fight in its fluttering shadow. At the crown of the banner sits a glorious adamantium eagle – the symbol of the White Scars’ bloody victory on Golgotha, from which the Banner of the Eagle took its name.|

This Relic replaces a power sword, master-crafted power sword or relic blade and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The White Scars’ armoury contains many swords forged in the style of traditional Chogorian tulwars. Of these, the most singular and storied is the Scimitar of the Great Khan. Chapter lore holds that this weapon was blessed by Jaghatai himself during the Purging of Daikeos. Soon after, the weapon’s bearer, his champion Ghorotei, struck the head from the Ironwyrm King in single combat.|

These purebred beasts were said to descend from the thundering herds of ancient Terra, and be imbued with an elemental swiftness that inspires all true sons of Chogoris.|
000002456|Glaive of Vengeance|Relics of Chogoris|Model equipped with a khan’s spear only. This Relic replaces a khan’s spear and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The Glaive of Vengeance was once wielded by the great Kyublai Khan, before his murder by the Drukhari of the Bloodied Talon. Some claim that the spirit of Kyublai Khan still clings to the glaive, and his endless thirst for vengeance grants the blade great power.|
000002457|Adamantine Mantle|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine. When combined with armour and energy fields, it has been shown time and again that these symbols of office are proof against even the very strongest attacks.|
000002458|Artificer Armour|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|A model with this Relic has a Save characteristic of 2+ and a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior protective capabilities that rival even Terminator plate. All who set eyes upon the wearer know that an honoured champion of the Imperium stands before them.|
000002459|Master-crafted Weapon|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one weapon that model is equipped with (this cannot be a weapon whose profile includes the word ‘master-crafted’). Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|Within the armouries of each Space Marine Chapter, the finest artificers seek to fashion weapons of ornate magnificence and utter lethality. The weapons of Chogoris have machine spirits as ferocious as raging aduu, and deliver the full fury of the storm.|
000002460|Digital Weapons|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile. When resolving that attack, if a hit is scored the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed lasers fitted into finger rings, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy point-blank from an unexpected angle when a weakness in their guard is spotted.|
000002461|Equis-pattern bolt pistol|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|Model equipped with a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol only. This Relic replaces a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The Techmarines of the White Scars have walked the line of heresy more than once with their fiercely independent approach to adapting STC technologies. The Equis is one such instance, a variant bolt pistol design that strains the capabilities of the gun’s machine spirit to the limit by firing rapid flurries of bolts as its wielder charges into battle. Equis-pattern weapons are rare; their hyper-accelerated rate of fire soon burns out their mechanisms, martyring the pistols within a few short years of battle.|
000002462|Headtaker’s Trophies|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|Subtract 1 from the Leadership characteristic of enemy units whilst they are within 6" of a model from your army with this Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|Many sons of the Khan display the polished skulls of the greatest of their conquered enemies upon their armour on large trophy racks. Those who oppose these swift warriors are filled with dread, for even the mightiest champions cannot help but envision their own severed head becoming a macabre decoration atop those gleaming spikes.|
000002463|Stormwrath Bolts|White Scars Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Bolt-Weapons">bolt weapon</a> that model is equipped with. When the bearer shoots with that weapon, you can choose for it to fire a stormwrath bolt. If you do, you can only make one attack with that weapon, but the weapon has a Strength characteristic of 7 and an Armour Penetration characteristic of -1 for that attack. If the target of that attack is a <span class="kwb">MONSTER</span>, the weapon has a Damage characteristic of D6 for that attack.||true|SM|Space Marines|Fashioned according to ancient designs by Chogorian artificers and intended for use in hunting the macro-predators of the Khum Karta Mountains, these acid-etched bolt shells contain a secret alchemical propellant formula, and their explosive cores are laced with fulgurite that strikes like caged lightning within the target.|

Circling high above the battlefield, the cyber eagle feeds a constant stream of optic and auspex data to the helm’s wearer, overlaying their autosenses with targeting projections and auto-prognosticatory hostile proximity alerts.|

000002480|The Ebonclaws|Relics of Ravenspire|Model equipped with two lightning claws only. This Relic replaces two lightning claws and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted for a long lost champion of the Raven Guard, the night-black blades of these ancient lightning claws have remained viciously sharp through centuries of war.|
000002481|The Armour of Shadows|Relics of Ravenspire|When resolving an attack made with a weapon that has an Armour Penetration characteristic of -1 against a model from your army with this Relic, that weapon is treated as having an Armour Penetration characteristic of 0. In addition, when resolving an attack against a model from your army with this Relic, an unmodified <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a> of 1, 2 or 3 always fails.||true|SM|Space Marines|The beautifully crafted plates of this mysterious armour articulate without the slightest sound, while its power pack emits barely more than a purr. Stranger still, a cowl of shadows seems to hang around the wearer, billowing like smoke when they move.|
000002482|The Raven Skull of Korvaad|Relics of Ravenspire|Once per turn, when resolving an attack made by a model from your army with this Relic, you can re-roll the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a>, <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a> or damage roll. In addition, if a model from your army with this Relic is destroyed as a result of an attack made by an enemy unit, then until the end of the battle, when resolving an attack made by a friendly <span class="kwb">RAVEN</span> <span class="kwb">GUARD</span> unit against that enemy unit, add 1 to the hit roll.||true|SM|Space Marines|Sondek Korvaad was a selfless hero of the Raven Guard who gave his life defending a medicae facility from the Nightstalkers of Sheng. The scrimshawed raven skull talisman retrieved from Korvaad’s body is said to bestow his legendary might upon its wearer, and should it fall into enemy hands, the Chapter will spare no effort to recover it.|
000002483|Ex Tenebris|Relics of Ravenspire|Model equipped with a master-crafted stalker bolt rifle, master-crafted occulus bolt carbine or master-crafted instigator bolt carbine only. This Relic replaces a master-crafted stalker bolt rifle, master-crafted occulus bolt carbine or master-crafted instigator bolt carbine and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Ex Tenebris is a masterwork bolter fitted with an incredibly sophisticated telescopic scope system. Chapter legend has it that the weapon was forged by Corax himself, as a gift for his wayward brother, the Night Haunter. But the Horus Heresy turned the two Primarchs’ Legions against one another, and Ex Tenebris was instead borne into battle by heroes of the Raven Guard.|
000002484|Oppressor’s End|Relics of Ravenspire|Model equipped with combat knife only. This Relic replaces a combat knife and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Wreathed in a shimmering power field, the monomolecular edge of this unassuming blade has cut short the reigns of countless oppressors, tyrants and demagogues.|
000002485|Adamantine Mantle|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine. When combined with armour and energy fields, it has been shown time and again that these symbols of office are proof against even the very strongest attacks.|
000002486|Artificer Armour|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|A model with this Relic has a Save characteristic of 2+ and a 5+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Crafted by the finest artificers of the Chapter, these ornately detailed suits of armour provide superior protective capabilities that rival even Terminator plate.

Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|The forging of surpassingly lethal blades and firearms is regarded as a sacred art on Kiavahr, where entire sanctums of artifice are given over to the arming of the greatest Raven Guard heroes.|
000002488|Digital Weapons|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile.

000002490|Silentus Pistol|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|Model equipped with bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol only. This Relic replaces a bolt pistol or heavy bolt pistol and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The lost forge world of Vantius specialised in creating weapons of silent murder. Ironically it was overrun by an assault by Drukhari Mandrakes, but not before a handful of its secrets had been preserved by the Raven Guard. The highly classified Silentus modification rituals that came from Vantius elevate bolt sidearms into softly spoken but utterly lethal assassination weapons.|
000002491|Korvidari Bolts|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Bolt-Weapons">bolt weapon</a> that model is equipped with. When that model is chosen to shoot with, you can choose for that weapon to fire a korvidari bolt. If you do, when choosing targets for that model and when choosing ranged weapons, that weapon’s Range characteristic is increased by 6" and it can target units that are not visible to the bearer, but only one attack can be made with that weapon.||true|SM|Space Marines|Etched with raven-feather charms, the abnormally long casings of korvidari bolts are packed with extra propellant for superior range. Each bolt also houses a minute, hyper-sensitive targeting and flight correction relay, allowing for a marksman’s accuracy even against heavily obscured foes.|
000002492|Shard of Isstvan|Raven Guard Special-issue Wargear|Add 1 to the Attacks characteristic of a model with this Relic. In addition, the bearer has the following ability:<br><br><b>Shard of Isstvan (Aura):</b> While a friendly <span class="kwb">RAVEN</span> <span class="kwb">GUARD</span> unit is within 6" of the bearer, each time a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Morale-Tests">Morale test</a> is taken for that unit, it is automatically passed.||true|SM|Space Marines|Following the Raven Guard’s escape from Isstvan V at the outset of the Horus Heresy, Corax gifted each of his surviving Legionaries with a shard of his shattered armour. Though most of these shards are now lost, some are still preserved in reliquaries or worn as talismans, each one acting as a potent source of hope and courage.|

Add 1 to the Toughness characteristic of a model with this Relic. When resolving an attack made against that model, reduce any damage inflicted by 1, to a minimum of 1.||true|SM|Space Marines|Inspired by Cawl’s new marks of battle plate, the Iron Fathers sanctioned the creation of the Aegis Ferrum. Forged by the combined effort of artificers hailing from every clan company, the armour’s indomitable resilience is said to symbolise the Chapter’s own.|
000002496|The Mindforge|Relics of Medusa|Model equipped with a force sword, force axe or force stave only. This Relic replaces a force sword, force axe or force stave and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|Consisting of a web of psycho-circuitry that is relayed through the wearer’s helm and gauntlets and into the force weapon they wield, this remarkable device possesses a rudimentary machine sentience. It bonds irrevocably with its host, augmenting their strength and optimising the blaze of psychic power that surges through their chosen weapon.|
000002497|Betrayer’s Bane|Relics of Medusa|Model equipped with a combi-melta only. This Relic replaces a combi-melta and has the following profile:<br><br>When you choose this weapon to shoot with, select one or both of the profiles below. If you select both, subtract 1 from <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit rolls</a> for attacks made with this weapon.||true|SM|Space Marines||

Until the start of your next battle round, when resolving an attack made against that <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> unit, if the bearer is within 3" of that <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> unit you can reduce any damage suffered by 1, to a minimum of 1 (this is not cumulative with any other rules that reduce damage).||true|SM|Space Marines|This device is mag-clamped to the gorget of the bearer, where it gathers power from his armour, gradually awakening the cluster of potent machine spirits that lurk within its coldly glowing shell. When a nearby vehicle suffers battle damage, the Ironstone connects to the beleaguered machine, possesses its spirit and swiftly begins guiding repairs of the damage.|
000002499|The Tempered Helm|Relics of Medusa|Whilst a model from your army with this Relic is on the battlefield, you can roll one D6 for each <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Command-Points">Command Point</a> you spend to use a Stratagem; on a 5+ that Command Point is refunded. You can only have 1 Command Point refunded per battle round by this Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|The savant-processor within this helm filters incoming information and presents it in compartmentalised strategic sermons, granting a near-omnipotent level of instant battlefield cognition.|
000002500|The Gorgon’s Chain|Relics of Medusa|A model with this Relic has a 4+ <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Invulnerable-Saves">invulnerable save</a>. When resolving an attack made with a ranged weapon against that model, subtract 1 from the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|This small augmetic module is fitted within its owner’s armour, linking through his black carapace and extending monomolecular mechadendrites into his hearts. Thus connected, it draws power from its owner to generate a potent protective field that robs incoming shots of their strength.|
000002501|Adamantine Mantle|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine.

000002503|Master-crafted Weapon|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one weapon that model is equipped with (this cannot be a weapon whose profile includes the word ‘master-crafted’). Add 1 to the Damage characteristic of that weapon. That weapon is considered to be a Chapter Relic.||true|SM|Space Marines|Where other Chapters labour long in the decoration of their finest blades and firearms, the Iron Hands care only for functionality. Of course, any who would denigrate the works of Medusa’s skilled sons are soon silenced when the power of these weapons is unleashed. |
000002504|Digital Weapons|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic fights, it can make 1 additional attack using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Select-Weapon">close combat weapon</a> profile. When resolving that attack, if a hit is scored the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed lasers fitted into finger rings, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet – in the case of the Iron Hands they have been known to replace entire digits. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy from an unexpected angle.|
000002505|Auto-medicae Bionics|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|If a model with this Relic has lost any wounds, at the start of your turn it regains up to D3 lost wounds.||true|SM|Space Marines|Some of the most complex bionics grafted onto the sons of Ferrus Manus incorporate systems similar to an Apothecary’s narthecium gauntlet. Rapid-suture applicators, hyper-adrenaline dispensers and the like render a warrior so augmented as to be almost indestructible.|
000002506|Teeth of Mars|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|Model equipped with an Astartes chainsword only. This Relic replaces an Astartes chainsword and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|The Iron Hands and their successors share a close bond with the Mechanicus of Mars. Thosewho show a particular affinity for communing with machines may be granted a cog-toothed chainsword bearing the sigil of the Omnissiah.

000002507|Haywire Bolts|Iron Hands Special-issue Wargear|When you give a model this Relic, select one <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/space-marines/#Bolt-Weapons">bolt weapon</a> that model is equipped with. When the bearer shoots with that weapon, you can choose for it to fire a haywire bolt. If you do, you can only make one attack with that weapon, but when resolving that attack, if it is made against a <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> unit, an unmodified <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a> of 4-5 inflicts D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a> on the target in addition to any other damage, and an unmodified wound roll of 6 inflicts 3 mortal wounds on the target in addition to any other damage.||true|SM|Space Marines|Containing implosive cores refined from Medusa’s electro-conductive sagatellum ore and guided by auto-fulminatory machine spirits, these bolt rounds detonate with crackling blasts that exorcise hostile machine spirits and burn out cogitator circuitry.|

When a model with this Relic uses their <span class="redfont">Blessing of the Omnissiah</span> ability, roll two dice when determining how many lost wounds are regained and discard one of the results.||true|SM|Space Marines|The Techmarines of the Iron Hands and their successors have a much stronger affinity with the machine spirits of their weapons and vehicles than those from most other Chapters. Fortis-pattern data spikes allow these warrior-priests to commune directly with the machines, both to placate their spirits and to facilitate more efficient repairs. |

The stories of Osrak’s defeat of the nine Daemon Lords of the Maelstrom may well be apocryphal, as might his cleansing of the plague vessel Morbiditus. The toppling of the Gallowfortress, the sundering of the Inimical Gate and the single-handed liberation of Shormidar – all of these are deeds attributed to Osrak that may have grown in the telling. Whatever the truth of these stories, none contest Osrak’s sheer psychic might. Even now, centuries after his death, the scrimshawed remains of his skull radiate a formidable power. With proper training, a Librarian of the same gene-seed can bend the Bones of Osrak to his will, accomplishing feats beyond the ken of his fellow psykers.|

Bestowed upon those champions of the Chapter who face especially trying and crucial battles, Duty’s Burden is an exceptionally lethal and utterly trustworthy weapon whose determined machine spirit echoes that of the Crimson Fists themselves.|
000002516|Adamantine Mantle|Imperial Fists Special-issue Wargear|When a model with this Relic would lose a wound, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.||true|SM|Space Marines|These flowing cloaks are laced through with threads of braided adamantine.

When resolving that attack, if a hit is scored the target suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> and the attack sequence ends.||true|SM|Space Marines|Digital weapons are concealed lasers fitted into finger rings, bionic implants or the knuckles of a power-armoured gauntlet. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy point-blank from an unexpected angle when a weakness in their guard is spotted.|
000002520|Fist of Terra|Imperial Fists Special-issue Wargear|Model with a power fist only. This Relic replaces a power fist and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|These ornate power fists are reputed to be remaining examples of the vaunted Solarite gauntlets used in the fighting on the walls of Terra at the height of the Horus Heresy. Crafted from the most potent materials and rare amongst the Imperial Fists even ten thousand years ago, these finely crafted weapons have sundered the foes of Mankind across the galaxy.|

000002559|Book of the Reviler|Artefacts of the Word Bearers|Model that is not a <span class="kwb">DAEMON</span> only. Before the battle, a model with this Relic can read from the Book of the Reviler. If it does, randomly generate two Chaos Boons for that model from the table found in the <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/chaos-space-marines/#Stratagems">Chaos Boon Stratagem</a>, re-rolling Spawndom and Daemonhood and duplicate results. Note that doing so does not cost any <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Command-Points">Command Points</a>, and an enemy <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Characters"><span class="kwb">CHARACTER</span></a>, <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> or <span class="kwb">MONSTER</span> model does not have to have been destroyed.||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|None can truly say what knowledge the Book of the Reviler contains. One glimpse at its pages is an affront to the senses, a sickening assault on one’s sanity at the barbarous truths the tome contains. Those with the fortitude to read the lines of this heinous opus manifest mutated boons of Chaos for their efforts.|
000002560|The Malefic Tome|Artefacts of the Word Bearers|<span class="tooltip00788" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00788" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00788"><span class="kwb">PSYKER</span></span> model only.<br><ul><li>The bearer knows one additional psychic power from their chosen discipline.</li><li>When a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Psychic-Tests">Psychic test</a> is taken for the bearer, add 1 to the total.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This unholy tome has been stitched together from the flayed skins of a dozen mortal psykers. Each leathery page still bears the hairs and birthmarks of the book’s unwilling donors, their horror emanating from every inch of stolen skin. The book’s leaves are inscribed with true names, hexagrammatic diagrams and daemonic hierarchies that offer the bearer abominable insights into the powers of the Warp.|
000002561|Ashen Axe|Artefacts of the Word Bearers|Model with chainaxe only. This Relic replaces a chainaxe and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The Ashen Axe dates back to the Great Crusade, a vicious chainaxe that was oft used on the citizens of worlds that rejected compliance. As the Legion descended into darkness, Daemons of the Warp were drawn in, feeding off the anguish and misery that its chained blades created. The Ashen Axe has become a malefic nexus for the creatures of the immaterium. Enemies of the Word Bearers find themselves unable to flee from the axe’s blows, as claws and talons grasp at their limbs and root them to the spot. In truth, their minds are assailed by the entities of the aether, circling impatiently for the soul feast the Ashen Axe will deliver.|
000002562|Epistle of Lorgar|Artefacts of the Word Bearers|<span class="tooltip00789" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00789" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00789"><span class="kwb">PRIEST</span></span> model only.<br><ul><li>When the bearer chants a prayer, you can re-roll the dice to determine if that prayer is heard.</li><li>The bearer has the following ability: ‘<span class="redfont">Epistle of Lorgar (Aura)</span><b>:</b> Add 1 to the Leadership characteristic of models in friendly <span class="kwb">WORD</span> <span class="kwb">BEARERS</span> units whilst their unit is within 6" of the bearer.’</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|One hallowed artefact above all is an epistle from the Book of Lorgar. When a priest reads from its pages, the very air turns metallic and the words summon dark blessings from the immaterium. All those who accept the words into their soul are imbued with its energy.|
000002563|Flayer|Artefacts of the Night Lords|Model with power sword only. This Relic replaces a power sword and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|When the Legion’s frightful tendencies came to the fore, the Flayer was the tool that carved the skin to be hung in the Night Haunter’s throne room. The foulest of deeds were done with this blade, and its reputation grew within the VIII as a relic of dread. Only the most malevolent Legionnaires can bear its heinous lineage.|
000002564|Stormbolt Plate|Artefacts of the Night Lords|<span class="tooltip00790" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00790" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00790"><span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span></span> model only.<br><ul><li>The bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+.</li><li>The bearer always counts as being <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-and-Cover">in cover</a>, even while it is not entirely on or within a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-Features-1">terrain</a> feature.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This artificer armour was fashioned from a strange metal smelted in the darkest pits of long dead Nostramo. It is not the war-plate’s incredible durability, however, that has made it so prized amongst the Night Lords. It is wreathed in a cloying darkness, an unnatural skein of midnight that perpetually shrouds the wearer. So it is that a warrior with the Stormbolt Plate pounces on their prey from the shadows.|
000002565|Vox Daemonicus|Artefacts of the Night Lords|<span class="tooltip00790" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00790" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00790"><span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span></span> model only.<br><ul><li>The bearer has the following ability: ‘<span class="redfont">Vox Daemonicus (Aura)</span><b>:</b> Whilst an enemy unit is within 6" of the bearer, reduce the range of that enemy unit’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Aura-Abilities">aura abilities</a> to 1".

The chill whispers of the Vox Daemonicus have unmanned brave commanders and undermined masterful strategies; many a best-laid plan has been torn to shreds by its baleful curse.|
000002566|Talons of the Night Terror|Artefacts of the Night Lords|Model that can <span class="tooltip00791" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00791" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00791"><span class="kwb">FLY</span></span> only. This Relic has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|Worn over a pair of boots, these talons give the wielder the appearance of some eldritch raptor-beast that has evolved to better disembowel prey. Should one sporting these bladed accoutrements descend feet first into the ranks of his quarry, the talons will eviscerate all those too slow to evade them. A heartbeat later, the crushing weight of the Chaos Space Marine wearer will be brought to bear with sickening, spine breaking impact.|
000002567|Scourging Chains|Artefacts of the Night Lords|<ul><li>Improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of melee weapons the bearer is equipped with by 1 (e.g. AP 0 becomes AP -1).</li><li>Subtract 1 from the Attacks characteristic (to a minimum of 1) of enemy models whilst they are within <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Engagement-Range">Engagement Range</a> of the bearer.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The Scourging Chains once jangled from the rafters of the Primarch’s throne room. Many a soul judged guilty by the Night Haunter has been hanged from their jagged spikes. As the wearer flies towards his victims, these spiked chains appear taut as corded tendons, loosening and looping before impact. By lashing out and making sharp contact, captured prey are helpless to avoid the killing blow.|
000002568|Misery of the Meek|Artefacts of the Night Lords|Once per battle, at the start of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, the bearer can drink from the Misery of Meek. That model immediately regains up to D6 lost wounds, and until the start of your next turn, add D3 to that model’s Attacks characteristic.||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This elixir is crafted by one of the Legion’s few remaining apothecaries. He will hunt Legion slaves, scraping a life of meagre existence in the dark recesses of Night Lords vessels, and distil the fear and suffering of these unfortunate victims. Vials are then sold for supplies, passage and power. When a son of Nostramo indulges in the sickening contents, they are imbued with new energy.|
000002569|Drakescale Plate|Artefacts of the Alpha Legion|<span class="tooltip00790" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00790" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00790"><span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span></span> model only.<br><ul><li>The bearer has a Save characteristic of 2+.</li><li>When the bearer would lose a wound as a result of a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a>, roll one D6; on a 5+ that wound is not lost.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|A suit of Corvus-Alpha-pattern power armour forged by an ancient tech-savant of the Dark Mechanicum, this battle plate incorporates the living titanium scales of the mica skydrake. Its wearer is so well protected by that elder beast’s innate resistance to damage, that even a flamestorm cannon’s channelled inferno splashes harmlessly aside, like water from smooth pillars of obsidian.|
000002570|Mindveil|Artefacts of the Alpha Legion|<ul><li>At the start of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, if the bearer is on the battlefield, roll 3D6; until the end of that phase, the bearer’s Move characteristic is equal to the result.</li><li>In the Movement phase, the bearer can move across other models and <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-Features-1">terrain</a> as if they were not there.</li><li>In the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#CHARGE-PHASE">Charge phase</a>, the bearer can move across other models (other than <span class="kwb">BUILDINGS</span>) as if they were not there.</li><li>The bearer can charge in a turn in which they <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back">Fall Back</a>.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|Shimmering with illusion, the Mindveil is a long cloak stitched with the interlocking teeth of Dostoy Prime’s chameleonic hydrasharks. So potent are the spells of confusion and dislocation cast upon it that the bearer is accompanied by incorporeal mirages that mirror his appearance. Stranger still, at a chanted command in the Dark Tongue, the wearer’s true location and that of his doppelganger can switch places, an instant translocation that leaves his enemies gaping in confusion.|
000002571|Hydra’s Wail|Artefacts of the Alpha Legion|Once per battle, at the start of the battle round, if the bearer is on the battlefield it can activate the Hydra’s Wail. Until the end of the battle round, when your opponent spends <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Command-Points">Command points</a> to use a Stratagem, roll one D6; on a 4+ your opponent must spend one extra Command point to use that Stratagem, or else it has no effect and the Command points spent so far are lost.||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The Hydra’s Wail is a sophisticated jamming device corrupted by the ruinous powers. A burst of directed scrapcode infiltrates the vox networks and the communications devices of the enemy, rendering strategic planning null and void. Its blasts are limited, so ritualistic offerings are needed after each use to replenish its deadly charge.|
000002572|Viper’s Bite|Artefacts of the Alpha Legion|Model with combi-bolter only. This Relic replaces a combi-bolter and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This ornate boltgun has a wide, serpent head muzzle and a magazine that never seems to run dry. When it fires, it makes no noise louder than a dry hiss, but a cacophony of screams is never far behind. The projectiles it fires glow with acrid green flames, and the energy swathing each bolt is so virulent that they can sizzle through even the ancient war-plate of Terminator-armoured veterans.|
000002573|Hydra’s Teeth|Artefacts of the Alpha Legion|Model with a bolt weapon (see <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/chaos-space-marines/#Malicious-Volleys">Malicious Volleys</a>) only. The bolt weapons of the bearer are granted the following abilities:<br><ul><li>Attacks made with this weapon automatically hit the target (including when using the <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/chaos-space-marines/#Stratagems">Daemon Shell</a> stratagem).</li><li>This weapon wounds on a 2+ unless it is targeting a <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> or <span class="kwb">TITANIC</span> unit, in which case it wounds on a 6+.</li><li>Units do not receive the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-and-Cover">benefit of cover</a> to their <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw">saving throws</a> against attacks made with this weapon.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The legend goes that these bolt rounds are sentient in the manner of Daemon weapons, and that sorcerous powers have somehow given them a terrible hunger for destruction. Once fired, they seek out fresh victims before exploding in a blast of eye-searing, lung-scorching gas.|
000002574|Shadeblade|Artefacts of the Alpha Legion|Model with power sword or force sword only. This Relic replaces a power sword or force sword and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This blade is rumoured to be of xenos origin. Within its hilt lies unknown cloaking technology that turns the wielder into naught but shadow when in darkness and low light.|
000002575|Siegebreaker Mace|Artefacts of the Iron Warriors|Model with power maul or accursed crozius only. This Relic replaces a power maul or accursed crozius and has the following profile:<br><br>When the bearer fights, select one of the profiles below.||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|A vast sphere of dense star-metal bound with sigils of shattering, the Siegebreaker Mace, mounted on the wrist-thick pole of a captured Adeptus Astartes standard, was created with acts of destructive symbolism in mind.|
000002576|Cranium Malevolus|Artefacts of the Iron Warriors|In your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a>, the bearer can use the Cranium Malevolus instead of shooting. Roll one D6 for each enemy <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> unit within 9" of that model; on a 4-5 that unit suffers D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a>, and on a 6 that unit suffers 3 mortal wounds.||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This iron-clad death’s head is a mouthpiece for the mind-shattering language of the soul forges. The coded blurts of Dark Tongue it emits are potent enough to undo the machine spirits of enemy technology.|
000002577|Insidium|Artefacts of the Iron Warriors|<ul><li>The bearer gains the <span class="kwb">DAEMON</span> keyword (if it does not already have it).</li><li>Add 1 to the Strength, Toughness and Wounds characteristics of the bearer.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This vast suite of bionics was originally implanted to avoid the mutating effects of the immaterium, but the warp is fickle. Insidium and its bearer are now a warped host of the techno-virus. Flesh and bionic alike have melded into a sickening union of mutated horror, while the bearer’s disdain for their own corruption rots away at their soul. Nonetheless, a fusion of mortal, Daemon and machine has turned them into an unstoppable leviathan.|
000002578|Axe of the Forgemaster|Artefacts of the Iron Warriors|Model with power axe or daemonic axe only. This Relic replaces a power axe or daemonic axe and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|Masters of the Daemon forges have long had to ensure dominance over their creations. Such are the energies of unmaking bound into this axe’s haft that a single blow can turn an adamantium-hulled tank into a pile of rusted scrap.|
000002579|Spitespitter|Artefacts of the Iron Warriors|Model with combi-bolter only. This Relic replaces a combi-bolter and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The unbridled hate of this weapon’s various wielders has corrupted its spirit over 10,000 years in the warp. The weapon now bucks with venom from every round that leaves its chamber, an essence of loathing that trails the explosive casing. For each loyal servant of the Corpse Emperor destroyed, this weapon and its wielder make one small step towards victory in the Long War.|
000002580|Techno-venomous Mechatendrils|Artefacts of the Iron Warriors|<span class="tooltip00792" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00792" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00792"><span class="kwb">WARPSMITH</span></span> model only. This Relic replaces mechatendrils and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The morass of mechanical tentacles that grace the wearer’s back are possessed of an insidious and cruel consciousness, for they are a collection of several small and deadly Daemon Engines.|
000002581|The Endless Grin|Artefacts of the Emperor’s Children|The bearer has the following ability: ‘<span class="redfont">Endless Grin (Aura)</span><b>:</b> Subtract 1 from the Leadership characteristic of models in enemy units whilst their unit is within 6" of the bearer and, when a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Morale-Tests">Morale test</a> is taken for an enemy unit within 6" of the bearer, your opponent must roll one additional D6 and you can choose one of those dice to be discarded.’||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This fleshy mask is the still living, flayed face of a man who begged Slaanesh to fulfil his wish to live forever. The Dark Prince was only too pleased to oblige, gifting the unfortunate soul immortality, but also forcing him to present his face to the Chaos Lord Shixe. After butchering the supplicant, Shixe wore that face as a prized reminder of the occasion for several centuries. The Endless Grin has since exchanged hands many times, but the potency of its anguish has never diminished.|
000002582|Fatal Sonancy|Artefacts of the Emperor’s Children|This Relic is a weapon that has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|Xenotech implants grafted into the bearer’s neck give them the ability to emit a hypermodulated scream, powerful enough to shatter diamond. The myriad resonant frequencies and sheer deafening power of this scream hits with a physical impact, blasting away flesh and bone alike, and reducing its victims to a shuddering pulp.|
000002583|Armour of Abhorrence|Artefacts of the Emperor’s Children|<ul><li>Enemy units cannot fire <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Overwatch">Overwatch</a> at the bearer.</li><li>The bearer has the following ability: ‘<span class="redfont">Armour of Abhorrence (Aura)</span><b>:</b> If an enemy unit fails a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Morale-Tests">Morale test</a> whilst it is within 6" of the bearer, one additional model flees from that unit.’</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|A canvas of the perverse, this suit of armour turns the wearer into an effigy of excess. Captured warriors of the enemy will adorn its plate, a mosaic of dark exuberance that delights the Emperor’s Children, but instils sheer horror in their enemies. In battle, warriors experience utter revulsion at the ghastly display, and feel a brief reluctance at firing upon their captured brothers. Before they come to their senses, the bearer is in their midst.|
000002584|Remnant of the Maraviglia|Artefacts of the Emperor’s Children|<span class="tooltip00789" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00789" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00789"><span class="kwb">PRIEST</span></span> model only. Once per battle, instead of chanting a <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/chaos-space-marines/#Prayers-to-the-Dark-Gods">prayer</a>, the bearer can broadcast the Remnant of the Maraviglia. Until the end of that battle round, the bearer gains the following ability: ‘<span class="redfont">Remnant of Maraviglia (Aura)</span><b>:</b> When resolving an attack made by a model in a friendly <span class="kwb">EMPEROR’S</span> <span class="kwb">CHILDREN</span> unit within 6" of a model with this Relic, you can re-roll the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a>.’||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|A rare recording of the grand symphony played for the Emperor’s Children at the onset of the Horus Heresy. The original performance saw the final descent of the Legion into debauchery and darkness. When transmitted through vox-casters, purpose built into the Dark Apostle’s armour, mere seconds of this perverted symphony is enough to drive the servants of Slaanesh into a furore of excess.|
000002585|Distortion|Artefacts of the Emperor’s Children|Model with power sword or force sword only. This Relic replaces a power sword or force sword and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The unblemished sheen of this faultless blade reflects an alluring countenance to the bearer, their seemingly unmatched beauty a peerless example of perfection. In reality, the bearer is a hideous wretch, every ounce of elegance leeched away to power the blade’s fearsome edge.|
000002586|Raiment Revulsive|Artefacts of the Emperor’s Children|<ul><li>When resolving an attack made by the bearer, you can re-roll the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a> and you can re-roll the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a>.</li><li>When a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">charge roll</a> is made for the bearer, you can re-roll the result.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|A cloak stitched with the skins of defeated mortals, the Raiment Revulsive is a symbol of contempt and hatred for those lesser than the Emperor’s Children. The screams of anguish that come from the still living faces of its diabolic hide are a sweet concerto to the ears of the wearer. It imbues them with unbridled confidence in their ability to best enemies, flay their hides in victory, and add their still screaming throes to the length of this grisly mantle.|
000002587|Crimson Killer|Artefacts of the World Eaters|Model with plasma pistol only. This Relic replaces a plasma pistol and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This ornate pistol fires blasts of crimson plasma that crackle with murderous power and fierce energies that ignite body and soul alike. The bearer will oft follow up with a decapitating head strike and claim the singed skull for Khorne.|
000002588|Gorefather|Artefacts of the World Eaters|Model with chainaxe only. This Relic replaces a chainaxe and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|This immense chainaxe is said to have once been wielded by Angron himself. Though it was ultimately cast aside, this relic is of such immense importance to the Legion that wars have been fought between rival warbands seeking to claim it for themselves. One strong enough to wield Gorefather can scythe his enemies into scattering explosions of blood and ruined flesh.|
000002589|Banner of Rage|Artefacts of the World Eaters|<span class="tooltip00789" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00789" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00789"><span class="kwb">PRIEST</span></span> model only. Once per battle, at the start of the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>, the bearer can unfurl the Banner of Rage.

It radiates palpable waves of anger and an urge for slaughter that beat upon the minds of those nearby, driving them into a killing frenzy.|
000002590|Berserker Glaive|Artefacts of the World Eaters|Model with power axe or axe of dismemberment only. This Relic replaces a power axe or axe of dismemberment and has the following profile:||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The bearer of this Daemon-infested killing tool is driven to a state of apoplectic frenzy by the proximity of its red-hot steel. His fellow World Eaters treat him with great caution, shunning him as a dangerous maniac even amongst his own bloodthirsty kind whilst venerating him as a living totem of rage. A host of Bloodletters are bound into the weapon’s fabric, and by channelling the life essence of those it slays, the vampiric Daemon weapon ensures its isolated host can fight like a man possessed for weeks on end.|
000002591|Helm of Furore|Artefacts of the World Eaters|<span class="tooltip00790" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00790" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00790"><span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span></span> model only.<br><ul><li>Add 2 to the Strength characteristic of the bearer.</li><li>At the start of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#CHARGE-PHASE">Charge phase</a>, if the bearer is within 8" of any enemy units and it is eligible to <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">declare a charge</a> with, it must declare a charge.</li></ul>||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|The bearer of such a trophy is a champion that puts aside all concepts of loyalty. Only bloodshed and victorious combat matter. Within the helm a spiteful machine spirit lurks that stokes the bearer’s butchers nails to even higher levels of frenzy, driving them further into the famed bloodlust that claims the sanity of the World Eaters.|
000002592|Bloodhunger|Artefacts of the World Eaters|When an enemy model is destroyed in the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a> as a result of an attack made by the bearer, roll one D6; on a 4+ the bearer regains up to 1 lost wound.||true|CSM|Chaos Space Marines|Bloodhunger is a sentient suit of armour bonded with the wearer. This unholy union creates a mutual craving for red viscera harvested by battle. If indulged, armour and wearer alike heal grievous injuries and damage. When a champion of Khorne is linked with this unholy artefact and set loose into the midst of war, their symbiosis imbues them until there are no remaining adversaries to sake their thirst.|

With its host’s reach and lethality extended, fragments of pathogenesis can stretch out to the bodies of many more prey, by infesting the bio-ammunition or riding through the bioelectric charge.

All surviving records refer to it only as the Wrath of Baal, for that is what its presence heralds. Where it flies, its depiction of Sanguinius framed by his angelic wings spurs his sons to leap further and higher. The teardrops of polished bloodstone remind them of their Primarch’s and Chapter’s sacrifice, and so they burn their jump packs hard, the swifter to bring the retribution of the Blood Angels down upon their foes.|

When that model is chosen to shoot with, you can choose for that weapon to fire a quake bolt.

Each time a melee attack is made against a unit that is felled, add 1 to that attacks <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a>.||true|SM|Space Marines|Each quake bolt is crafted individually by a Magos of the Adeptus Mechanicus and contains a warhead that emits a pulsed shock wave.

In the case of the Blood Angels they are known to be, in themselves, items of great beauty fashioned with immense care. Short-ranged and powerful, they are typically triggered in the midst of melee in order to blast the enemy from an unexpected angle.|

This Relic replaces frag grenades and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|These red spheres contain small servo-automata ringed with multiple circular gyro-saws like miniature astrolabes.

So it did, yet as that star set, so the light faded and the Cosmic Serpent realised it had been fooled. Its wrath grew more terrible as the star’s light slipped away; so it is with this blade, said to be fashioned from the very fang that the Laughing God stole. As the hour grows later and the battle’s crescendo draws nigh, so the blade flashes ever faster through the air, chased by shuddering, shadowy after-images that solidify suddenly into their own stabbing fangs.|

Inscribed upon the sword in minute script is the entire tale of the Fall of the Aeldari, as narrated by the Shadowseers.

Supposedly, it was given as a gift by a wanderer of the webway, who members of that masque claim was none other than the Laughing God. While many doubt the word of the Veiled Path in this, there can be no denying that Crescendo is a beautifully crafted and uniquely potent firearm. When the pistol’s trigger is pulled, micro-distortion engines engage within its housing, allowing an impossible volley of firepower to be unleashed.|

This Relic replaces a Harlequin’s kiss and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|Representing the barbed gift given in jest by the Laughing God to the crone Morai-Heg, Cegorach’s Rose contains thorned monofilaments of shadowsilk. Existing in the penumbra between realspace and the labyrinth dimension, these shadowsilk strands bypass even the thickest armour as though it did not exist. Once within the body of the victim, the rose’s threads uncoil, a blossom of molecule-thin blades unfurling at the end of each. The foe is slain instantly as a thicket of bloody, bladed roses blossoms within their chest.|

Yet when the wearer moves, they are engulfed in a shimmering cloud of refracted starlight that blinds and confuses the foe. This effect is magnified when the wearer moves quickly, the blurred glow swelling to become a blazing corona almost impossible to see through. So does the wearer mimic Aelos, the heavenly star flung by Cegorach himself that smote Vaul’s treacherous assistant Ghaevyll and blinded him for his deceits.|

Psychic powers flicker and die in the pendant’s presence, for the Laughing God will not suffer his children to be beset by any tendril of the warp. This aura of abnegation extends not only to the pendant’s wearer, but billows like a concealing cloak to shield nearby allies. So does Cegorach watch over his followers, guarding them from the predations of She Who Thirsts.|
000003851|The Avenging Blade|Aspect Shrine Relics|<a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/aeldari/Dire-Avengers">Dire Avenger Exarch</a> model with diresword only.

This Relic replaces a Harlequin’s kiss and has the following profile:||true|AE|Aeldari|The monofilament wire encased within this ornate Harlequin’s kiss is incredibly tightly wound. When the weapon pierces the target’s body, this lashing wire flails around as though with a life of its own, tearing the victim to bloody pieces and lacerating their fellows. This horrific dismemberment - and the subsequent look of horror on the faces of the victim’s comrades - brings great amusement to the bearer, their mocking laughter echoing across the battlefield.|

When grasped, blood drips from the bearer’s gauntlets, and a fell light glows from their eyes. Enemies struck by the blade feel their life force absorbed, and even the tiniest nick caused by its edge refuses to heal.|

Of all the sacred statues raised to honour Mina’s final battle, the Icon of the Crimson Martyr is held in special reverence by her Order. Imagifiers who bear it to battle have been known to fight on through seemingly mortal wounds, their stentorian voices conveying the truth of Mina’s martyrdom to those around. With shouted conviction, they tell their Sisters how, when the hour is darkest and foes close upon them, then will ferocious dedication, faith and skill at arms see even the most indomitable foe cast down in bloody damnation.|

This Relic replaces a combat knife or paired combat blades and has the following profile:||true|SM|Space Marines|This поп-reflective blade lacks the ornamentation seen on many Adeptus Astartes legendary weapons. Its seemingly humble design belies its dreaded power, and a number of dark myths surround reports of Space Marines wielding such a weapon.

While its power plant and fibre bundles operate with hardly a whisper, the Armour Umbral projects a barely-perceptible aural rendering of the surrounding soundscape, masking the wearers presence with the sigh of the wind and the rustle of vegetation. Coupled with a shrouding field that returns a wash of false signals to targeting systems, the warrior is as good as a ghost.|

From the wound, the shells final act is to expel a gaseous hallucinogen, rendering the silent victim doubly horrific to their shocked allies.|
