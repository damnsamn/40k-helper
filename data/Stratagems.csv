Any model in that unit that ends its Fall Back move within Engagement Range of any enemy model is destroyed. Assuming the unit is not destroyed, it cannot do anything else this turn (i.e. it cannot attempt to <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Manifesting-Psychic-Powers">manifest psychic powers</a>, <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">shoot</a>, <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">declare a charge</a>, be selected to fight etc.), even if it has a rule that would allow it to do so after <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back">Falling Back</a>.|000002134004|

These units are not affected by the destroyed model's Explodes ability (or equivalent) — instead you must roll one D6 for each model you just set up on the battlefield. Instead of one model that disembarked (your choice) being destroyed for each roll of 1, one model that disembarked (your choice) is destroyed for each roll of 1 or 2. Units cannot <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">declare a charge</a> or <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Performing-a-Heroic-Intervention">perform a Heroic Intervention</a> in the same turn that they disembarked from a destroyed <span class="kwb">TRANSPORT</span> model.|000002134005|

When that unit Advances, add 9" to its Move characteristic until the end of the Movement phase instead of making an Advance roll.|000004392007|
|UNRELIABLE SCANNER RETURNS|Defender Stratagem|2|Though the enemy seems sure of the location of their targets, sometimes information isn’t as reliable as they might hope.||Use this Stratagem during deployment, after your opponent has set up their army. Select up to D3 Command Vehicles and set them up again, anywhere in your deployment zone.|000004392008|

|ACCESS HATCH|Defender Stratagem|1|Lurking inside the hull, these warriors make use of reinforced maintenance hatches to emerge in the midst of the invading forces.||Use this Stratagem at the end of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>. Select a unit from your army that has not yet been set up on the battlefield and set it up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" away from any enemy models.|000004393005|

Roll one D6 for each of those captured <span class="kwb">CHARACTER</span> markers. On a 4+ that marker is removed.|000004398002|
|DETERMINED DEFENCE|Defender Stratagem|1|Through rousing oratory, grit and determination, these warriors will die rather than let the enemy capture this area.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MORALE-PHASE">Morale phase</a>. Select one unit from your army that is within 3" of any <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Objective-Markers">objective markers</a>.

|OUT OF SIGHT|Defender Stratagem|3|Sometimes, when fleeing for your life, you just need to get into cover and re-evaluate your options.||Use this Stratagem at the end of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a> if your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#The-Warlord">Warlord</a> is wholly within a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-Features-1">terrain feature</a>. Until your next Movement phase, your Warlord cannot make attacks with ranged weapons, but cannot be selected as the target of an attack made with a ranged weapon by an enemy model.|000004400002|
|COORDINATED ASSAULT|Defender Stratagem|1|The defenders see an opportunity to force an opening, marshalling their remaining forces to breach a single point with strength of numbers.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>.

|ADDITIONAL REINFORCEMENTS|Defender Stratagem|3|Wave upon wave of defenders swamp the attackers, bleeding them at every step.||Use this Stratagem at the end of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, during the second or third battle rounds. Select one destroyed unit from your army with a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Power-Ratings">Power Rating</a> of 10 or less.

|NOWHERE TO HIDE|Defender Stratagem|2|Search and destroy teams have been equipped with specialised equipment to hunt down the enemy agent.||Use this Stratagem at the end of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, if no unit from your army searched a site as the result of the Search Site rule that turn. One <span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span> or <span class="kwb">BIKER</span> unit that is wholly within 6" of one of the zones labelled A, B or C can attempt to search it exactly as if it were in that zone. A unit from your army cannot search a site again that turn.|000004411002|
|SCRAMBLER FIELD|Defender Stratagem|2|The spy hunters erect a scrambler field to prevent enemy locator-augurs from locking on, either to spirit their agent away or send reinforcements to their aid.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the battle round. Until the end of that battle round, any enemy units that arrive from reinforcements can only be set up wholly within their own deployment zone, and the enemy’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#The-Warlord">Warlord</a> cannot be removed from the battlefield as the result of an ability, psychic power or Stratagem (they can <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Embark">embark</a> within a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Transports"><span class="kwb">TRANSPORT</span></a> model, but that model is similarly restricted from being removed from the battlefield).|000004411003|
|CLOSE IN ON THE PREY|Defender Stratagem|2|The elimination of the enemy agent is of the highest priority. Once they are located, nearby patrols are diverted to home in on the quarry.||Use this Stratagem in any phase, when an <span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span> or <span class="kwb">BIKER</span> unit from your army is destroyed while the enemy’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#The-Warlord">Warlord</a> is on the battlefield.

Roll one D6; on a 2+, that model’s unit suffers D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a>.|000004405003|
|SYNAPSE NODES|Devoured World Stratagem|2|Seeded across the planet, these unassuming pods provide an anchor for the synaptic control of lesser tyranid bioforms.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the first battle round. Until the end of the battle, <span class="kwb">TYRANID</span> units that are within 3" of any <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Objective-Markers">objective markers</a> are treated as being within 24" of a <span class="tooltip00135" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00135" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00135"><span class="kwb2">&lt;<span class="kwb3">H</span>IVE</span> <span class="kwb">FLEET&gt;</span> <span class="kwb">SYNAPSE</span></span> unit for the purposes of the <a href="/wh40k9ed/factions/tyranids/#Instinctive-Behaviour">Instinctive Behaviour</a> ability.|000004403002|
|FADE AWAY|Forest Worlds Stratagem|2|The dense undergrowth of many forest worlds makes a perfect place to disappear from sight.||Use this Stratagem in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a> before an <span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span> or <span class="kwb">SWARM</span> unit from your army <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Fall-Back">Falls Back</a>. Remove that unit from the battlefield instead and place one small marker at the location of the last model to be removed. At the end of any of your subsequent <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phases</a>, you can set that unit up again wholly within 18" of the marker and more than 9" away from any enemy models. Any units that have not returned to the battlefield at the end of the battle are treated as having been destroyed.|000004389002|
|CAUGHT IN THE OPEN|Hive World Stratagem|1|In hive war, to eschew cover is to embrace death.||Use this Stratagem in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a> when a unit from your army is chosen to shoot with. Select one enemy unit that is wholly visible to the chosen unit and is not receiving the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-and-Cover">benefit of cover</a>. Until the end of that phase, when resolving an attack made by a model in the chosen unit against the selected unit, if the target is within half range, you can re-roll the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a>.|000004404002|
|STAND FIRM|Honourable Stratagem|1|Alliances are forged on trust. If you break your word and flee in the face of the enemy who will ever trust you again?||Use this Stratagem in the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MORALE-PHASE">Morale phase</a>, after a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Morale-Tests">Morale test</a> taken for an <span class="kwb">HONOURABLE</span> unit from your army is passed. Until the end of the phase, each time a Morale test is taken for another unit, if it is within 6' of that <span class="kwb">HONOURABLE</span> unit, before that Morale test is taken, you can choose for that Morale test to be automatically passed.|000006138002|
|SIDE BY SIDE|Honourable Stratagem|1|When two exemplars of battle fight side by side in perfect unity, no force in the galaxy can stop them.||Use this Stratagem at the start of any battle round. Select one <span class="kwb">HONOURABLE</span> <span class="kwb">CHARACTER</span> unit from your army and one <span class="kwb">HONOURABLE</span> <span class="kwb">CHARACTER</span> unit from an opponent’s army. Until the end of the battle round, while the selected units are within 6" of each other, each time one of those models makes an attack, the controlling player can re-roll a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound roll</a> of 1.|000006138003|
|RAPID DROP ASSAULT|Planetstrike Attacker – Battle Tactic Stratagem|1|The generals of the attacking forces are adamant that their target should fall, and have tasked their elite troops to spearhead the assault in order to achieve their goal.||Use this Stratagem in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#CHARGE-PHASE">Charge phase</a>, before declaring a charge with a unit from your army that arrived from <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Strategic-Reserves">Strategic Reserves</a> this turn. Until the end of the phase, if that unit has the <span class="kwb">INFANTRY</span>, <span class="kwb">BEAST</span>, <span class="kwb">SWARM</span> or <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Flying"><span class="kwb">FLY</span></a> keyword, each time you make a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">charge roll</a> for that unit, roll one additional D6 and then discard one D6 of your choice.|000006111002|
|SCORCHED SKIES|Planetstrike Attacker – Battle Tactic Stratagem|3|Some invasion forces employ such an unrelenting barrage of Drop Pods and heavy munitions that the skies turn into a roiling maelstrom. In the final moments before a planetfall, the defenders witness the skies themselves tear and burn.||Use this Stratagem before you launch the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Firestorms">Firestorm</a>. When you launch the Firestorm, if you are playing a Combat Patrol or Incursion battle, make an 1 additional Firestorm Attack, or if you are playing a Strike Force or Onslaught battle, make D3 additional Firestorm Attacks. You can only use this Stratagem once.|000006111003|
|DARKEN THE SKIES|Planetstrike Attacker – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|2/3|Whether by taking advantage of an eclipse, blotting out the sun with the bulk of a vast spacecraft or inducing darkness with even more esoteric means, the attackers bring the shroud of night to the battlefield for a few vital moments.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the battle round. Until the end of the battle round, each time a ranged attack is made against a target unit that is more than 12" away, subtract 1 from that attacks <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a>. You can only use this Stratagem twice during the battle. If it is the first time you are using this Stratagem during a battle, it costs 2CP; otherwise, it costs 3CP.|000006111004|
|TECHNO-SPIRIT CURSE|Planetstrike Attacker – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|1/2|The attacker has assailed the enemy strongholds with a terrible electronic affliction, causing their bastions and automated weapons systems to malfunction and even jam at critical moments.||Use this Stratagem at the start of your opponent’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a>. Select one <span class="tooltip00159" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00159" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00159"><span class="kwb">BUILDING</span></span> on the battlefield. Until the end of the turn, each time that model makes a ranged attack, subtract 1 from that attack’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a>. If that <span class="kwb">BUILDING</span> is <span class="kwb">TITANIC</span>, this Stratagem costs 2CP; otherwise, it costs 1CP. Each Building can only be selected for this Stratagem once per battle.|000006111005|
|GROUND OBSERVER|Planetstrike Attacker – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|1|The attacking forces have planted forward observers deep within the enemy territory. Their covert signals enable not only the main invasion force a far greater chance of making a successful planetfall, but also their ordnance to slam home with unfailing accuracy.||Use this Stratagem when resolving a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Firestorms">Firestorm Attack</a>, after rolling to determine which Firestorm marker is hit, or in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, after you have failed a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Reserve-Rolls">Reserve roll</a>.<br><ul><li>If you use this Stratagem when resolving a Firestorm Attack, you can change the result of the D6 roll by +1 or -1 (if you modify a roll of 1 by -1, it becomes a 6, and if you modify a roll of a 6 by +1, it becomes a l).</li><li>If you use this Stratagem in your Movement phase, that Reserve roll is considered to have been passed instead.</li></ul>You can only use this Stratagem twice, unless you are playing an Incursion mission (in which case you can use it up to three times), or a Strike Force Mission (in which case you can use it up to four times), or an Onslaught mission (in which case you can use it up to five times).|000006111006|
|HEAVY DUTY DROP|Planetstrike Attacker – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|1|The bulk lifter pilots who deploy an invasion’s support fighters can, in desperate circumstances, drop their cargo directly onto the field of battle. These emergency drops are notoriously risky, as no bulk lifter wants to hang about over a battlefield for long!||Use this Stratagem in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, when a <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> or <span class="kwb">MONSTER</span> unit from your army (excluding <span class="kwb">TITANIC</span> units) arrives from <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Strategic-Reserves">Strategic Reserves</a>, before setting that unit up. That unit can be set up anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" from any enemy models.|000006111007|
|LASERBURN|Planetstrike Attacker – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|2|In the still of the void above, crosshairs fall upon the image of a doomed stronghold. Without warning, a pillar of searing ruby light flashes downwards and carves a great scar across the planet’s surface.||Use this Stratagem in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#COMMAND-PHASE">Command phase</a>. Place three <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Firestorms">Firestorm markers</a> (or dice), numbered 1-3, anywhere on the battlefield such that all three are within 12" of each other. At the start of your next Command phase, roll two D3s (roll again if a double is rolled until two different results are rolled). Draw a straight, imaginary line between the two corresponding Firestorm markers, and then roll one D6 for each unit that this line crosses over, adding 1 to the result if that unit is a <span class="tooltip00159" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00159" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00159"><span class="kwb">BUILDING</span></span>: on a 2-5, that unit suffers D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a>; on a 6+, it suffers D3+3 mortal wounds instead. The Firestorm markers are then removed. You can only use this Stratagem once.|000006111008|
|HIGH YIELD FIRESTORM|Planetstrike Attacker – Wargear Stratagem|1|With a tremendous roar, massive, high-yield ordnance hurtles out of the bruised skies into the ranks of the warriors below, destroying every structure caught in the resultant explosion in a blinding conflagration.||Use this stratagem when resolving a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Firestorms">Firestorm Attack</a>, before rolling to determine which Firestorm marker is hit. When resolving that Firestorm Attack, each <span class="tooltip00159" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content00159" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content00159"><span class="kwb">BUILDING</span></span> unit within 6" of the centre of the corresponding Firestorm marker suffers an additional D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a>.|000006111009|
|RAPID REINFORCEMENTS|Planetstrike Defender – Battle Tactic Stratagem|1/2|The planetary defenders maintain strong supply lines. This enables them to react swiftly to repulse the invader's forces.||Use this Stratagem in your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, before making any <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Reserve-Rolls">Reserve rolls</a>. If you spent 2CP on this Stratagem, select up to two of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Strategic-Reserves">Strategic Reserves</a> units; otherwise, select one of your Strategic Reserves units. Those units automatically arrive this turn - no Reserve rolls are required.|000006112002|
|COORDINATED REDEPLOYMENT|Planetstrike Defender – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|2|As the invaders’ deployment patterns reveal themselves and fresh intel on their attack plans is assessed, the defenders must redress their lines to ensure that they can survive the initial onslaught and strike the foe where they are weakest.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the first battle round after the Attacker has set up their <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Firestorms">Firestorm</a> markers, but before they have launched the Firestorm. Select up to three units from your army that are in your deployment zone and redeploy them (you cannot select units with the Fortification <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Battlefield-Role">Battlefield Role</a>). Any of those units can be placed into <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Strategic-Reserves">Strategic Reserves</a> without having to spend any additional <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Command-Points">CPs</a>, regardless of how many units are already in Strategic Reserves. If both players have abilities that redeploy units, <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Roll-offs">roll off</a>; the winner chooses who redeploys their units first. You can only use this Stratagem once.|000006112003|
|FOXHOLES|Planetstrike Defender – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|2|The defenders have wasted no time in digging themselves in, honeycombing the land with makeshift trenches and foxholes.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the first battle round, after the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Firestorms">Firestorm</a> has been resolved. Until the end of the battle round, all units in your army (except <span class="kwb">AIRCRAFT</span>, <span class="kwb">BUILDING</span> and <span class="kwb">TITANIC</span> units) that are <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Within-and-Wholly-Within">wholly within</a> your deployment zone gain the benefit of <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Light-Cover">Light Cover</a> and <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Heavy-Cover">Heavy Cover</a>.|000006112004|
|DROP ZONE DENIAL|Planetstrike Defender – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|2/3|The defenders expect an orbital drop from the invaders, and have sought to make it as hazardous as possible. Flooded fields, obstacles and raging fires all render areas impossible for a landing.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the battle round. Select one battlefield edge that is not the Attacker’s battlefield edge. Until the end of that battle round, none of the Attackers <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Strategic-Reserves">Strategic Reserves</a> can be set up within 6" of that battlefield edge. You can only use this Stratagem twice during the battle. If it is the first time you are using this Stratagem during a battle, it costs 2CP; otherwise, it costs 3CP.|000006112006|
|STASIS TRAP|Planetstrike Defender – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|2|The defender has secreted one of the most arcane weapons in the 41st Millennium - a stasis field trap. When triggered, the unfortunate attacker is wreathed in a shimmering force field that temporarily holds it imprisoned in a pocket of time like an insect in amber.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>. Select one unit in your opponent’s army that made a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Charging-with-a-Unit">charge move</a> during this turn. That unit is not eligible to fight until after all other eligible units have fought this phase.|000006112007|
|DIRECTIONAL POWER FIELD|Planetstrike Defender – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|1|The defenders have activated an ancient device that can generate a localised power field, and though it will provide only temporary reprieve from the orbital barrage, it should hold out long enough.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the first battle round, when your opponent launches the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Firestorms">Firestorm</a> and before any Firestorm Attacks are made. Select one unit from your army. Until the Firestorm has been resolved, each time a model in that unit suffers a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a>, roll one D6: on a 4+, that wound is not lost.|000006112008|
|KRAK MINES|Planetstrike Defender – Strategic Ploy Stratagem|2|The defender has placed a series of minefields across the wastes of no man’s land, each surrounded by nests of krak grenades on hair-thin triggers. Should the enemy use these as coordinates for their planetary landing they are in for a very nasty surprise...||Use this Stratagem in your opponent’s <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a>, after they have set up a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Reinforcements">Reinforcement</a> or <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Strategic-Reserves">Strategic Reserves</a> unit on the battlefield anywhere that is not <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Within-and-Wholly-Within">wholly within</a> the Attacker’s deployment zone. Roll three D6s for each <span class="kwb">VEHICLE</span> or <span class="kwb">MONSTER</span> model in that unit, and one D6 for every other model in that unit. For each roll of 5+, that unit suffers 1 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wound</a> (to a maximum of 6 mortal wounds). You can only use this Stratagem once.|000006112009|
|TARGETING JAMMERS|Planetstrike Defender – Wargear Stratagem|1/3|The defender has deployed powerful jamming emitters that scramble orbital targeting sensors, throwing the invader's bombardments off.||Use this Stratagem at the start of the first battle round, after the Attacker has set up their Firestorm markers but before they launch the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/containment/#Firestorms">Firestorm</a>. If you spent 1CP, you can select one of those markers; if you spent 3CP, you can select two of those markers. You can move each of the Firestorm markers you selected by up to 2D6" in any direction, rolling separately for each marker. The markers cannot be moved off the battlefield.|000006112005|
|NEW ORDERS|Stratagem|2|||Use this Stratagem after generating your Tactical Objectives at the start of your turn. Immediately discard a Tactical Objective and generate a new one.|000002137002|
|SEWER RATS|Stratagem|2|||This Stratagem is used just before you set up an INFANTRY unit during deployment. Instead of setting up that unit on the battlefield, they are infiltrating the city’s sewer network. At the end of any of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phases</a>, you can set the unit up anywhere on the battlefield at street level that is more than 9" from any enemy model and not in a city ruin.|000002138002|
|MEDICAE FACILITY|Stratagem|1|||This Stratagem is used after both sides have deployed, but before the first battle round begins. Nominate a single city ruin to house the Medicae Facility. Roll a dice each time a model loses a wound whilst occupying that city ruin; on a 6, the model has been healed by the medicae equipment and does not lose that wound.|000002138003|
|BOOBY TRAPS|Stratagem|1|||This Stratagem is used after both sides have deployed, but before the first battle round begins. Secretly nominate a single city ruin to house the Booby Traps and write this down – this cannot be a city ruin that is currently occupied by any models. The first time any model, moves into the city ruin, they trigger the Booby Traps and suffer D3 <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Mortal-Wounds">mortal wounds</a> (D6 if they were <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Advance">Advancing</a>).|000002138004|
|DEATH IN THE STREETS|Stratagem|1|||This Stratagem can be used when a unit with a Height Advantage shoots an enemy unit that is entirely at street level and not <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-and-Cover">in cover</a>. You can re-roll all failed hit and <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#2.-Wound-Roll">wound rolls</a> when resolving shots at that enemy unit.|000002138005|
|EVASIVE MANOEUVRES|Stratagem|1|||This Stratagem is used when one of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Battlefield-Role">Flyers</a> is targeted by an enemy Flyer in a Dogfight. You can re-roll all failed <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#4.-Saving-Throw">saving throws</a> made for that Flyer this phase, but you must subtract 1 from any <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit rolls</a> made for it until the end of the current turn.|000002142002|
|REFUEL, REARM, REPAIR|Stratagem|1-3|||This Stratagem is used as soon as one of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Battlefield-Role">Flyers</a> Leaves Combat Airspace. If you spend 1 CP, the aircraft automatically re-enters combat airspace at the end of your next <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#MOVEMENT-PHASE">Movement phase</a> – there is no need to roll a dice. If you spend 2 CPs, the aircraft also regains any weapons that are described as only being able to be used a limited number of times during a battle (bombs, etc.). If you spend 3 CPs, the aircraft also regains D3 wounds.|000002142003|
|BRIBE|Stratagem|1+|||You can use this Stratagem at any time to give any number of your remaining CPs to another player to bargain for a temporary ceasefire, alliance, betrayal, etc.|000002143002|
|TEMPORARY COMMS UPLINK|Stratagem|3|||Provided you have fewer than 6 active Tactical Objectives, you can use this Stratagem to immediately generate 1 extra Tactical Objective.|000002152002|
|ORBITAL BOMBARDMENT|Stratagem|2|||In your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a>, you may place six dice for <b>Meteoric Debris</b>, rather than 3. The dice should be numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.|000002155002|
|FIELD COMMANDER|Stratagem|1|This warrior’s specialist expertise is second to none and in battle they lead those under their command with sophisticated tactics.||Use this Stratagem before the battle if you used any Specialist Detachment Stratagems when choosing your army. Choose one <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Characters"><span class="kwb">CHARACTER</span></a> from your army that has gained a keyword from a Specialist Detachment Stratagem that is not your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#The-Warlord">Warlord</a> and is not a named character. You can give that character the Warlord Trait of the Specialist Detachment they are part of (note that this character is only regarded as your Warlord for the purpose of that Warlord Trait). This Stratagem can be used once for each Specialist Detachment Stratagem you have used (spend 1CP each time you use it). No two characters in your army can have the same Warlord Trait.|000003174002|
|RELIC OF ANCIENT GLORY|Stratagem|2|||This Stratagem is used at the beginning of your <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>. Choose a single friendly <span class="tooltip01314" data-tooltip-content="#tooltip_content01314" data-tooltip-anchor="#tooltip_content01314"><span class="kwb">RELIC</span></span> unit, all friendly ADEPTUS ASTARTES models within 6" of the chosen RELIC unit may re-roll the first failed <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit roll</a> of that phase.|000003318002|
|PREPARED POSITIONS|Stratagem|2|||Use this Stratagem at the start of the first battle round, before the first turn begins. Until the end of the first turn, all units from your army – other than TITANIC units, <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Aircraft">AIRCRAFT</a> units and units with the Fortification or Flyer <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Battlefield-Role">Battlefield Roles</a> – that are wholly within your deployment zone receive the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-and-Cover">benefit of cover</a>, even while they are not entirely on or in a <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#Terrain-Features-1">terrain</a> feature. A unit that is already receiving the benefit of cover gains no additional benefit from this Stratagem.|000003401002|

Remove that unit from the battlefield and set it up again anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" from any enemy models.|000004386002|
|ILLUSORY HEX|Stratagem|1|Deceptive manifestations cause enemy warriors to strike uselessly into nothingness.||Use this Stratagem after a unit from your army is chosen as the target of an attack in the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#FIGHT-PHASE">Fight phase</a>. Until the end of the phase, subtract 1 from <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#1.-Hit-Roll">hit rolls</a> for attacks that target that unit.|000004386003|
|INVISIBLE WARDS|Stratagem|1|Eldritch defences suck munitions into the warp and dissipate energy into harmless rays of light.||Use this Stratagem after a unit from your army is chosen as the target of an attack in the <a href="/wh40k9ed/the-rules/core-rules/#SHOOTING-PHASE">Shooting phase</a>.

|MALFUNCTIONING AUTO-DEFENSORS|War-torn Shrine World Stratagem|2|Some areas of the cathedrum still contain damaged weapon servitors or defensive auto-turrets, originally installed to corral pilgrims or guard relics.
